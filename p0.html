      <h2>First 10 Sketches</h2>
      <img class="image" src="images/img1.jpeg" alt="img1">
      <p>1st Image: I was definitely experimenting. Namely with multiple buttons (which I'd soon learn are not allowed). Was simply trying to combine as many things as I could to get an idea where to go with this whole thing. So I was putting
        together the fashion, the spider, the tech and the dog element.
        <br />2nd Image: This is when I started thinking about gamifying the whole thing a bit with a maze made of spiders around Sydney's dogs. The user'd then have to use the cursor to avoid spiders and reach the dogs. As a reward, a bunch of
        hearts appears.</p>
      <img class="image" src="images/img3.jpeg" alt="img3">
      <p>3rd Image: Again, experimenting with some fashion elements and multiple buttons. Also trying to incorporate some text response (depending on which sensor button on the dress is clicked).

        <br />4th Image: Customization and sound came to mind next so I simply imagined a button with Bentley and Ferrari where the user could give them some clothes. A click on the button would trigger a barking sound.</p>
      <img class="image" src="images/img5.jpeg" alt="img5">
      <p>5th Image: Here I was starting to think spatially a bit. Depending on the distance of the cursor, that looks like Sydney, the dogs'd either make happy or sad sounds.

        <br />6th Image: A damsel in distress scenario. There'd be a timer with spiders randomly appearing in the game area. The user then has to catch them all in time with the cursor that looks like a dog. Not even sure what the button was
        supposed to do.</p>
      <img class="image" src="images/img7.jpeg" alt="img7">
      <p>7th Image: My favorite with Sydney's sketchbook that, after a click, randomly spawns fashion related objects. So these items are essentially "falling out of the sketchbook." Once a spider falls out the game's over.

        <br />8th Image: Here the button serves as a response generator. The user selects what they want their cursor to look like and then click the button/Sydney and she reacts to it (a text response).</p>
      <img class="image" src="images/img9.jpeg" alt="img9">
      <p>9th Image: Something unrelated to Sydney - a Mark Zuckerberg button. After a click, it generates and releases a bunch of data for everyone in the world to see. And the cursor looks like a dollar symbol of course. No right person in their
        mind'd mess with their customer's data unless a financial incentive is given.

        <br />10th Image: And the last Sydney variation where the user selects a mood she's feeling right now and after a click an animation is played with the dogs taking care of her.</p>
      <h3>Contributions in this section</h3>
      <p>In a lot of cases I was trying to gamify the button a bit which my group members (and the class) liked. There were also some attempts at customization but that idea didn't end up being as appealing.</p>
      <h2>Variations</h2>
      <img class="image" src="images/var1.jpeg" alt="var1">
      <img class="image" src="images/var2.jpeg" alt="var2">
      <p>When narrowing down our options we decided to have 3 main things involved: Bentley and Ferrari, movement and some kind of transformation of the button.

        </br>Variation 1: My first idea was to have Sydney doing some Yoga in the button. When the button's clicked and held down, the dogs start closing in on Sydney from each side. Once they reach her, we get some hears and a picture with her
        being kissed by the dogs.

        </br>Variation 2: As for my second variation I was thinking about having a heart in the middle and as the user's holding it down it starts getting bigger and and bigger. At the same time the dogs start running toward the heart.</p>
      <h3>Contribution</h3>
      <p>The heart from my second variation was quite popular and we thought it'd look nice in conjungtion with maybe a slight color change which is what we implemented in the end. So the heart was my contribution in this section</p>
      <h2>Final Contribution</h2>
      <img class="image" src="images/final1.png" alt="final1">
      <img class="image" src="images/final2.png" alt="final2">
      <p>I contributed with the images of the dogs. I used iPad Autodesk Sketchbook to sketch out the outlines of the images and then transferred them to my Mac and made 2 vector images out of them in Affinity Designer.</p>
      <h2>The Button Itself</h2>
      <p>We decided to go with a heart in the middle which symbolizes Sydney. Then we have Bentley and Ferrari running around. When you press and hold down the button the dogs start slowing down and getting closer to the
        heart which in turn starts changing its color to purple. This metaphor is supposed to symbolize Sydney's "fashion tech dress" that turns purple when her dogs get closer. </br>Below this text you can watch an
        interaction with the button and at the very bottom you can try it yourself!</p>
